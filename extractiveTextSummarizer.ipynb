      "Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) and John (Martin Freeman) receive a visit from Henry Knight (Russell Tovey), who witnessed his father's death by a \"gigantic hound\" at Dartmoor 20 years ago. Though initially dismissive, Sherlock is soon interested in Henry's use of \"hound\" instead of \"dog\". Sherlock and John arrive in Dartmoor to find the hound is a local legend. Henry tells John and Sherlock about the words \"Liberty\" and \"In\" in his dreams. Sherlock, John, and Henry then visit the hollow in the hope of finding the hound. After John receives a call from Mortimer that Henry has run off with a gun, John, Sherlock, and Lestrade run to the hollow to find Henry about to commit suicide. Sherlock explains the hound was a hallucination; his father was killed by Frankland, wearing a gas mask and a sweatshirt with \"H.O.U.N.D. Liberty, In\" on it; a child could not cope with this, so his mind tricked him. Henry realises that Frankland murdered Henry's father because he found him testing the drug. As Sherlock and John prepare to leave the following day, John wonders why he saw the hound in the lab despite not having inhaled the gas from the hollow. He also points out Sherlock was wrong for once; he believed the drug was in Henry's sugar and put it in John's coffee.\n",

It brought significant changes in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, transportation, and technology, which had a profound impact on the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of the time. The revolution began in Great Britain and then spread to other parts of Europe and North America. Key innovations during this period included the steam engine, textile machinery, iron production, and the development of railways. These advancements led to increased productivity, urbanization, and the rise of factory-based industries. However, the Industrial Revolution also brought many challenges, such as poor working conditions, environmental degradation, and social inequality. Overall, it was a transformative period that laid the foundation for modern industrial societies.\n",
