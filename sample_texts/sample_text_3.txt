The Industrial Revolution was a period of major industrialization that took place during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It brought significant changes in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, transportation, and technology, which had a profound impact on the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of the time. The revolution began in Great Britain and then spread to other parts of Europe and North America. Key innovations during this period included the steam engine, textile machinery, iron production, and the development of railways. These advancements led to increased productivity, urbanization, and the rise of factory-based industries. However, the Industrial Revolution also brought many challenges, such as poor working conditions, environmental degradation, and social inequality. Overall, it was a transformative period that laid the foundation for modern industrial societies.
